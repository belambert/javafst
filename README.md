[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/belambert/javafst/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/belambert/javafst)

This is mostly taken from
[Sphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinx4/tree/master/sphinx4-core/src/main/java/edu/cmu/sphinx/fst)
with a small amount of clean-up, making it obey Google style checks, etc.

I've needed to extract this code from the Sphinx4 repo a number of times, so I
decided to finally give it another home here. I dont plan to make any major
modifications, but I might hack on it a little here or there. Please feel free
to make contributions.

Automatically generated javadoc [here](https://belambert.github.io/javafst/apidocs).

You might find [JOpenFst](https://github.com/steveash/jopenfst) to be useful too.

TODO
====

The original code could be modernized in a number of ways, especially to take
advantages of Java8 features.  Here is a short list of some of the things that
could be done:
- Use null less.
- The mutable/immutable distinction is a little weird.

Need tests, especially for:
- FST output
- Immutable FSTs

For reference you can find the C++ code [here](http://www.openfst.org/doxygen/fst/html).
